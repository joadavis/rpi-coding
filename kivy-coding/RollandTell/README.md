# Roll and Tell

A simple app to facilitate making up stories.

# How to Play

On load, the app should present you with 9 random picture tiles.  Move them
around as you make up a story based on the picture icons.  On a multitouch
device you can also rotate and resize the icons.


# Design

This game is a simple game in the vein of other story games like Rory's Story
Cubes, The Storybook Game, Dixit, whatever that Disney branded one was called, 
etc.  The fun comes when someone's imagination takes the story off in an
unexpected direction.

I had a lot of fun designing my own simple icons to use with the game.

The code is heavily based on a picture manipulation example in Kivy which I came
across through QPython, though written to my purposes.

## To Do

* Icon editor - make your own simple icon tiles
* Picture to icon - take a picture, use sw to simplify it down to a fun icon
* Icon sets - pick sets of icons to use in a game
* Fun animation
* Nicer background and interface graphics
* Options
  * no rotate tiles
  * starting size of tiles
  * more or less tiles
* other game modes like having a button to add tiles one at a time
