diamond mine card game
joadavis sept 25 2017

This is an old idea I had for a card game. I've spent many hours playing spades and hearts.
But why isnt there a game for diamonds?
So the idea is to have a game where diamonds are worth points and you are trying to mine them out of your hand.
Other suits are for actions.  Need a matching spade to mine a diamond.
Clubs are to take diamonds from other players.
Hearts are like magic or something and help you defend or keep diamonds. something like that. That is about as as far as I got.

so the idea is to write a program to help play test the concept.

In thinking about it you kind of need a scoring scale.
Ideas for scoring
* pinocle. 1 to 5 is 5 points. 6 to 10 is 10 points. face are 15
* value. what is on the card.
* flatter. 5 7 9 tiers?

To win: the first player to a target value. Depending on scoring it could be 15 or 24 or 50.
Achievable but not too fast.


First approach to clubs and  hearts is to make them only work on matches.
  if opponent has out 4 dia and you have 4 club you can take it. but if they have a 4 heart they play it in top to defend.

Another approach is to use as modifiers.  if opp has 4 dia and you have 2 club and 2 heart then you can attack

Consider also letting clubs be used to steal cards from another hand, go fish style.

Need to think about card cycling.  
Rounds might not be very interesting if you cant get the cards you want.
But it could get unbearable if you spend all your time defending endlessly.

one approach. draw a card (or two) every turn. no need to discard.
another. play whatever you want or discard. always end round with 5 cards.
another thought. allow playing a heart for draw 2 cards.
