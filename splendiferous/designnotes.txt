Design Notes for Splendiferous

joadavis 3/26/2016

I had started building this as a one file script, but then started adding classes and it got sloppy.
And I got annoyed when I had to add import statements and give . references to everything.

So I thought I better step back and think a little more about design.


Main object - Gamesession
This represents each play of the game
initialized with the number of players, and resets the player scores, bank, mine cards, and generates x number of new noble cards
Game is over when the winning player reaches 15 victory points


token
represent a gem with one of the 5 gem types, or a wild gold token
owned by the bank or one of the players

mine card
come in 3 ranks, each with a different value
each has a cost in various gems
each provides a gem in value for the player to use
each may also be worth 0 or more victory points

Noble card
each has a value in gems that they are wanting
the want is either 4 of two gems or 3 of 3 gems
each noble card is worth 3 victory points
there are a few nobles per game session, defined by the number of players
- for 2 players there are 3 nobles
each noble is either positioned at the top of the board (owned by bank)
 or visits (owned by) a player

Player
either a human or a computer
has tokens, mines and nobles
has a hand of mine cards
keeps a score, and can be queried to determine if it has won
takes a turn
- could make the turn method return the current victory points
- may attract one noble (at start or end of turn?)
- takes one of the following actions if allowed
-- takes 3 different gems
-- takes 2 gems of the same type if 4 or more in bank
-- takes a mine card into hand and takes a wild token
-- buys/builds a mine from board or hand into play
victory points totaled from nobles and mines in play

Most objects will need a draw method to trigger it rendering per refresh cycle
